## Packet Sniffer Tool

This is a python program that captures data flowing through an interface. When used together with the <strong>ARP Spoof tool</strong> (in another repository), it can act as a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and capture useful data between the victim and other machine.

Usage syntax: ````python3 packet_sniffer.py````
